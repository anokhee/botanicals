# generative-mini-biome

Feature ideas: 
- Auto-generated 5-color palette 
  > Users can click on a color to copy it... maybe... 
  
- Faint celestial bodies (other than the moon/stars)
- Occasional shooting star animations 
- Rain/snow animations 
  > Too resource intensive, possibly
- Time somewhere 
  > A glorified clock 
 - "Refresh landscape" transition
