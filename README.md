# botanicals
Generates procedural flower-like structures with L-Systems and randomized Bezier curves. 

WIP, sorry!! Redoing this with Vanilla JS. The <a href="https://anokhee.github.io/botanicals">current demo is accessible from here.</a>
If you are here from my Reddit post, or want to know how I got the flowers looking the way they do on my portfolio, checkout the `old` branch.

Otherwise, <a href="mailto:jandhyala.anokhee@gmail.com">send me an email</a> and I'll be happy to help. Thanks!!
